# kirbot
This is a Discord bot I made in Java for a club I'm in.
The main function of this bot is to assign users roles without the need of contacting a server admin.
It does this when it's asked and when a user enters the server.
THe bot also has some other functions created as a joke such as !anime, !smug, !help and !walk, all of these have a chance of being removed in the future and moved entirely to a diffrent bot, but for the time being will stay here.
